### Knapsack 1 - intuition

### Knapsack 2 - greedy algorithms

### Knapsack 3 - modeling
1. Subject to == s.t. == constraint; (2022年8月22日)

### Knapsack 4 - dynamic programming
1.  dynamic programming reduce capacity from high to low, table method increase capacity from low to high; (2022年8月22日)
2.  Since every recursive method has a corresponding iterative method, table method is the corresponding iterative method of dynamic programming; (2022年8月22日)
3. v(i,j) meaning: when capacity is j, total value after deciding item i. Item [1, i-1] have already been decided; (2022年8月22日)
4. how to draw dynamic-programming table, but do not show how to get the exact item selected: https://blog.csdn.net/qq_39133120/article/details/93623531 
5. how to get the exact item selected: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1K4411X766/?spm_id_from=333.788.recommend_more_video.-1&vd_source=3ef4175721f926fbf390a069da19b0ca

### Knapsack 5 - relaxation, branch and bound
1. Exhaustive Search - Definition. •A brute force solution to a problem involving search. for an element with a special property, usually among combinatorial objects such as a permutations, combinations, or subsets of a set. (2022年8月22日)
2. depth-first search; 

### Knapsack 6 - search strategies, depth first, best first, least discrepancy
1. depth-first search; 
2.
