# Xu's question to pay attention to
## Linguistic features
### L1: How to achieve plainness, precision and objectivity while following the stereotype of writing in English as writers did in preparation for some L2 testing essays? 
1. Pay attention to **plain, precise and objective expression**; (2023年1月19日)
2. chatGPT: To achieve plainness, precision, and objectivity in writing, it is important to use **clear** and simple language, avoid using overly complex sentence structures, and provide **evidence and examples** to support any claims made. To follow the stereotype of writing in English as used in preparation for L2 testing essays, it is important to adhere to **standard grammar** and punctuation rules, use a **formal and academic tone**, and avoid using colloquial or idiomatic expressions. Additionally, it is important to be objective and avoid using personal bias or opinion in the writing. (2023年1月19日)

### L2: May the writer’s preferences of some single verbs, like “find” or ”look into” instead of “identify” “or investigate”, remind readers of an immature writer? 
1. Pay attention to **more formal expression**. (2023年1月19日)
2. chatGPT: It is possible that a writer's preference for certain single verbs, such as "find" or "look into" instead of "identify" or "investigate," may remind some readers of an immature writer. However, it is important to note that writing style and word choice are subjective, and what one person perceives as immature may be viewed differently by another. It is important for a writer to use language that is **clear, precise, and appropriate** for their intended audience. It is also important to note that the use of specific words or phrases can convey a **particular tone** or emphasis that may be desired by the writer. Additionally, it is also important to consider the context and the **purpose of the writing**, as the use of certain words may be more appropriate in certain situations or genres. (2023年1月19日)

### L3: To what extent should a writer invite “self (say I or we)” into text while constructing a voice of authority in the paper? 
1. NO NEED, because our paper contain at least two people; (2023年1月19日)
2. chatGPT: The use of "self" (such as "I" or "we") in a text can be a tricky balancing act when constructing a voice of authority in a paper. On one hand, the use of "I" or "we" can make the writing feel more personal and approachable, which can be beneficial for certain genres or audiences. On the other hand, the use of "I" or "we" can also weaken the author's authority and objectivity if used excessively. // It is generally best to use "I" or "we" sparingly and strategically, especially in academic and professional writing where objectivity and authority are highly valued. When using "I" or "we", it is important to make sure that it is clear that the author is speaking from their own perspective and not making universal claims. // It is also important to use "I" or "we" when it is necessary to provide context or background information about the author's own experiences or research. In many cases, it is more appropriate to use third person point of view in academic or professional writing, as it emphasizes the research and the evidence rather than the writer's personal opinions. // Overall, it is important to consider the purpose and audience of the writing when deciding to use "I" or "we" and use it in a way that supports the author's credibility and authority.
