# Xu's question to pay attention to
1. L1: How to achieve plainness, precision and objectivity while following the stereotype of writing in English as writers did in preparation for some L2 testing essays? NO NEED; 
2. L2: May the writer’s preferences of some single verbs, like “find” or ”look into” instead of “identify” “or investigate”, remind readers of an immature writer? NO NEED; 
3. L3: To what extent should a writer invite “self (say I or we)” into text while constructing a voice of authority in the paper? NO NEED; 
4. L4: Could a new writer follow the use of informal expressions as the professional writers and expert writers did in their papers? NO NEED;
