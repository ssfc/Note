# Xu's question to pay attention to
## Linguistic features
### L1: How to achieve plainness, precision and objectivity while following the stereotype of writing in English as writers did in preparation for some L2 testing essays? 
1. Pay attention to **plain, precise and objective expression**; (2023年1月19日)
2. chatGPT: To achieve plainness, precision, and objectivity in writing, it is important to use **clear** and simple language, avoid using overly complex sentence structures, and provide **evidence and examples** to support any claims made. To follow the stereotype of writing in English as used in preparation for L2 testing essays, it is important to adhere to **standard grammar** and punctuation rules, use a **formal and academic tone**, and avoid using colloquial or idiomatic expressions. Additionally, it is important to be objective and avoid using personal bias or opinion in the writing. (2023年1月19日)

### L2: May the writer’s preferences of some single verbs, like “find” or ”look into” instead of “identify” “or investigate”, remind readers of an immature writer? 
1. Pay attention to **more formal expression**. (2023年1月19日)
2. chatGPT: It is possible that a writer's preference for certain single verbs, such as "find" or "look into" instead of "identify" or "investigate," may remind some readers of an immature writer. However, it is important to note that writing style and word choice are subjective, and what one person perceives as immature may be viewed differently by another. It is important for a writer to use language that is **clear, precise, and appropriate** for their intended audience. It is also important to note that the use of specific words or phrases can convey a **particular tone** or emphasis that may be desired by the writer. Additionally, it is also important to consider the context and the **purpose of the writing**, as the use of certain words may be more appropriate in certain situations or genres. (2023年1月19日)

### L3: To what extent should a writer invite “self (say I or we)” into text while constructing a voice of authority in the paper? 
1. NO NEED, because our paper contain at least two people; (2023年1月19日)
2. chatGPT: The use of "self" (such as "I" or "we") in a text can be a tricky balancing act when constructing a voice of authority in a paper. On one hand, the use of "I" or "we" can make the writing feel more personal and approachable, which can be beneficial for certain genres or audiences. On the other hand, the use of "I" or "we" can also weaken the author's authority and objectivity if used excessively. // It is generally best to use "I" or "we" sparingly and strategically, especially in academic and professional writing where objectivity and authority are highly valued. When using "I" or "we", it is important to make sure that it is clear that the author is speaking from their own perspective and not making universal claims. // It is also important to use "I" or "we" when it is necessary to provide context or background information about the author's own experiences or research. In many cases, it is more appropriate to use third person point of view in academic or professional writing, as it emphasizes the research and the evidence rather than the writer's personal opinions. // Overall, it is important to consider the purpose and audience of the writing when deciding to use "I" or "we" and use it in a way that supports the author's credibility and authority.
3. 


### L4: Could a new writer follow the use of informal expressions as the professional writers and expert writers did in their papers? 
1. NO NEED, because I am new writer; (2023年1月19日)
2. chatGPT: It is possible for a new writer to use informal expressions in their writing, but it is important to keep in mind that the use of informal language is generally more appropriate for certain types of writing, such as creative writing or casual writing, rather than academic or professional writing. In these types of writing, a more **formal and professional tone** is usually expected, and the use of informal language can weaken the writer's authority and credibility. // If a new writer is writing in an academic or professional setting, it is best to stick to formal language and avoid using overly casual or colloquial expressions. However, it is important to note that writing style and tone can vary depending on the field, the audience and the purpose of the writing. Therefore, it is always important to familiarize oneself with conventions and expectations of the type of writing you are doing. // If a new writer wants to use informal expressions in their writing, they should do it with caution and consider the context of their writing, it's audience and the tone they want to convey. They should also be aware that the use of informal expressions may make the writing less formal and less persuasive, and the writer should be prepared to explain the reason for the use of informal language.

### L5: How to acquire some appropriate words which make more sense in editor or reviewers’ stands, like the use of “questionable” instead of “wrong” when presenting arguments ? 
1. **Our presentation**; (2023年1月19日)
2. chatGPT: Acquiring appropriate words that make more sense from the perspective of editors or reviewers can be done by reading and studying examples of well-written academic and professional writing. By reading papers and articles written by experts in your field, you can get a sense of the types of language and vocabulary that are considered appropriate and effective for academic and professional writing. // It can also be helpful to consult a thesaurus or a dictionary of synonyms to find words that convey a similar meaning to the one you want to express, but that might be more appropriate or precise in a particular context. Additionally, you can use online resources such as grammar and style guides, which can provide guidance on word choice and usage in academic and professional writing. // For instance, instead of using the word "wrong" when presenting arguments, you could use words such as "questionable" or "doubtful" which implies that there is a level of uncertainty or that the argument is open to further examination. This kind of words gives a more nuanced approach and can be seen as more objective and less absolutist. // It's also important to remember that clear and precise language is key when writing for academic or professional audiences, and it is important to avoid using overly technical jargon or overly simple words, as both can make your writing less effective.

### L6: Why are some terminologies preferable in some disciplines, like method Vs methodology, while others are dynamic in different research areas? 
1. NO NEED, because we only focus on computer science; (2023年1月19日)
2. chatGPT: Some terminologies may be preferable in certain disciplines because they have specific meanings or connotations that are specific to that field of study. For example, in the social sciences, the term "methodology" is often used to refer to the theoretical and philosophical approach that underpins a study, while the term "method" is used to refer to the specific techniques and procedures used to collect and analyze data. In the **natural sciences**, the word "method" might be more preferred. // In other cases, the use of certain terminologies may be influenced by historical or cultural factors. For example, certain terms may have been popularized or developed by **influential scholars or institutions** in a particular field, and their use may have become deeply ingrained in the discipline. // In other fields, terminologies may be dynamic and can change over time as new technologies, theories, or discoveries are made. In these fields, the researchers may have to adopt new terminologies or redefine the existing ones to adapt to the new developments. // Additionally, terminologies may also vary depending on the audience and the purpose of the research. For example, technical terms may be used when communicating with other experts in the field, while simpler terms may be used when communicating with a lay audience. // In summary, the preference and use of certain terminologies may be influenced by a variety of factors, including the discipline, historical and cultural factors, the audience and the purpose of the research and the evolution of the field.

### L7: Does the ignorance of the nuance of some nominalizations, like discourse and language, acquisition and learning, cause any extent of bias among the reviewers? 
1. Same as L1; (2023年1月19日)
2. chatGPT: Ignorance of the nuances of certain nominalizations, such as "discourse" and "language," "acquisition" and "learning," **can potentially cause bias among reviewers**. Nominalizations are words that describe an action, process or state but are turned into nouns. They often have different connotations and implications, and thus, it is important to understand the subtle differences in meaning between them. // For example, "discourse" and "language" may be used interchangeably, but they can also have different connotations. "Discourse" is often used to refer to the way language is used in a particular context, often with a focus on the social and cultural factors that influence it. On the other hand, "language" is more general, and it refers to the system of communication used by a particular group of people. // Similarly, "acquisition" and "learning" can be used interchangeably, but they can also have different connotations. "Acquisition" is often used to refer to the process of **gaining knowledge or skills through experience or exposure**, while "learning" is more general and can refer to any process by which knowledge or skills are acquired. // If a reviewer is not aware of these nuances in meaning, they may not fully understand the author's argument or the context of the research, and this may lead to bias in their evaluation of the work. Therefore, it is important for both authors and reviewers to have a clear understanding of the meanings of the words they use and to use them appropriately in the context of their writing.

### L8: Does the pursuit of accuracy always demand use of long sentences? Or does complexity of sentence structure mean complicated ideas? 
1. Pay attention to **structure of sentences**. (2023年1月19日)
2. chatGPT: The pursuit of accuracy does not always demand the use of long sentences, and complexity of sentence structure does not always mean complicated ideas. Clear and concise writing is often more effective in conveying complex ideas, as it helps the reader to understand the main points more easily. // Long sentences can make it difficult for readers to follow the main idea, and they may also increase the risk of errors or ambiguities. Therefore, when striving for accuracy, it is important to use simple and direct language and to express ideas as clearly and succinctly as possible. // However, it's also important to note that the length of a sentence and its complexity can depend on the context and the audience. For example, in scientific or technical writing, longer and more complex sentences may be more appropriate, as they allow the author to convey specific information with precision. // In summary, accuracy and concision are not mutually exclusive. Striving for accuracy should not always demand the use of long sentences, and complexity of sentence structure does not always mean complicated ideas. Clear, concise and direct language can be more effective in conveying complex ideas. The length and complexity of sentences should be adapted to the context and the audience.

### L9: Does high frequency using of passive voice always help build up high quality paper while enhancing the persuasiveness and achieving objectivity? 
1. Pay attention to **passive voice**. (2023年1月19日)
2. chatGPT: The use of passive voice can be a useful tool in writing, but it is not always the best choice for building a high-quality paper or enhancing persuasiveness and objectivity. // Passive voice can be used to shift the focus away from the person or group performing an action, which can be useful for **achieving objectivity** in scientific or technical writing. For example, in a scientific study, it is more appropriate to report the results without highlighting the person or group who conducted the study, because the focus is on the results themselves. // However, using passive voice excessively can make writing less clear, less concise, and less engaging. Passive voice can also make sentences longer, and it can make it harder for readers to understand who is performing an action. // Additionally, using passive voice can also make it **harder to build persuasive arguments** because it can reduce the sense of agency and accountability. Passive voice can also make it harder to identify the actors in the text and that can make it harder for the readers to understand the text. // In summary, while passive voice can be a useful tool in some cases, such as in scientific or technical writing to **achieve objectivity**, it is not always the best choice for building a high-quality paper or **enhancing persuasiveness**. It's important to use it appropriately and in balance with other sentence structures.

### L10: Which is better in tense choice, the vivid, natural forms or the simple, timeless presentations? 
1. Pay attention to **description** of framework. (2023年1月19日)
2. chatGPT: In academic paper writing, it is generally recommended to use the past tense when discussing completed research or studies, and the present tense when discussing existing theories or hypotheses. The use of the simple, timeless present tense can lend a sense of objectivity and permanence to the research being discussed. The use of the vivid, natural forms may be appropriate in certain cases, such as when describing the methodology of a study, but should be used with caution to ensure that the writing remains clear and objective. Ultimately, the choice of tense will depend on the specific context and purpose of the paper.
