12. This paper examines the causes and satisfaction consequences of work-to-family and family-to-work synergy for a sample of organizationally-employed parents while controlling two types of work-family conflict: work interfering with family and family interfering with work. Participants included 1193 respondents from the 2002 National Study of the Changing Workforce who had a child under the age of 18 years at home. Work-family synergy is the frequency of experiencing positive energy and mood states from participating in both work and family. Synergy was significantly related to attitude toward employer, learning opportunities, autonomy, job pressure, supervisor support, dependent care, family income, mental health, self-rated health, and satisfaction outcomes. Gender similarities and differences in work-family synergy were identified. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

2. Since the time of Descartes, it is estimated that no fewer than five hundred attempts have been made to create artificial languages for international use. The most successful by far has been Esperanto, a language constructed around the end of the nineteenth century by Dr. Zamenhof of Poland. Esperanto is a language that is extremely easy to learn and speak, with its words drawn mainly from English, German, the Romance languages, Latin, and Greek. 
3. A more recent arrival on the international scene is Interlingua, scientifically constructed by a group of language experts out of Latin, the Romance languages, and English. But whereas Esperanto has a large body of people who actually speak it scattered throughout the world, Interlingua has not yet achieved much popularity (Pei 175-176). 
4. Key: 
5. (1) Since the time of Descartes, it is estimated that no fewer than five hundred at.tempts have been made to create artificial languages for international use. 这句话属于background介绍, 不需要出现在paraphrase中; 
6. (2) with its words drawn mainly from English, German, the Romance languages, Latin, and Greek. 这些具体组成细节不需要; 
7. (3) 必须包含实体(哲学概念): Artificial language, Esperanto, Interlingua; 
8. (4) 必须包含第一性质(哲学概念, 任何时刻都不能和物体相分离, 核心特征): Esperanto, successful=>widely accepted, easy=>accessible; Interlingua, not as mus as OR less influential; 
9. Page 93 and 94 in Book Writing Academic English: summary model; 
10. Page 5 of slides Definitions: using network, computer science papers; by network, medical papers; 
11. Practices of teacher education calling for a common language. calling是分词, 作为practices的限定和补充, 重点在practice. 
12. Practices of teacher education: a call for common languages. call是名词, 不定冠词a表示强调, call和practice构成并列关系; 
13. 注意名词和动名词的表达差异; 
14. it作为指代之外的另外三种用法: (1) nature element 时间天气; (2) functional 强调句, 形式主语; (3) the unknown; 
15. Page 42 in Book Writing Academic English: it指代问题; 
16. English has almost become an international language. Except for Chinese, more people speak **it** than any other language. Spanish is the official language of more countries in the world, but more countries have **it** as their official or unofficial second language. More than 70 percent of the world's mall is written in **it**. It is the primary language on the Internet. In international business, it is used more than any other language, and it is the language of airline pilots and air traffic controllers all over the world. Moreover, although French used to be the language of diplomacy, it has displaced it throughout the world. Therefore, unless you plan to spend your life alone on a desert island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, it is a useful language to know. 
17. Key: (1) speak it => speak English, 因为下文提到了Spanish, 使用it会造成指代混乱; 除非使用Moreover重建概念; 
18. (2) have it => have English, 中间夹杂了其他语言, 使用it会造成指代混乱; 
19. (3) In international business, it => English, 因为提到了any other language; ??? 
20. (4) it has displaced it => English, 因为提到了French; 
21. (5) it is a useful language => English, 因为提到了French; ???

2. Dolphins are interesting because they display almost human behavior at times. For example, they display the human emotions of joy and sadness. During training, when they do something correctly, they squeal excitedly and. race toward their trainer. When they make a mistake, however, they droops noticeably and mope around their pool. Furthermore, they help each other when they are in trouble. If one is sick, it sends out a message, and others in the area swim to help it. They push it to the surface of the wa.ter so that it can breathe. They stay with it for days or weeks-until it recovers or dies. They have also helped trapped or lost whales navigate their way safely out to the open sea. They are so intelligent and helpful, in fact, that the U.S. Navy is training them to become underwater bomb disposal experts.
3. Key: 
4. (1) they display => it displays; 对标下文的if one is sick; 
5. (2) Furthermore, they => dolphins; Furthermore重建概念, 所以需要重新使用dolphins; 
6. a student == all the students concerned, 具有最大范围; 
7. the students则加了限定; 
8. noun+s是专业上的赋能, 是专有名词的特征表述; water泛指水, waters则是专有名词水域; 
9. Page 43 in Book Writing Academic English: 视角稳定性; 
10. one paragraph one perspective, 一段话只能有一个视角; 
11. Olympic athletes must be strong both physically and mentally. First of aJl, if you hope to compete in an Olympic sport, you must be physically strong. Furthermore, aspiring Olympians must train rigorously. for many years. For the most demanding sports, they train several hours a day, five or six days a week,
for ten or more years. In addition to being physically strong, he or she must also be mentally tough. This means that you have to be totally dedicated to your sport, often giving up a normal school, family, and social life. Being mentally strong also means that he or she must be able to withstand the intense pressure of international competition with its attendants media coverage. FinalJy, not everyone can win a medal, so they must possess the inner strength to live with defeat. 
1.  Key: 
2.  (1) you => athletes, 视角应在athletes上, 而不是作为读者的you; 
3.  (2) he or she => they, 单复数变化也属于视角不稳; 
4.  (3) not everyone 模糊 => few 限定范围; 
5.  复杂概念的名词化; 
6.  Page 165 in Book Writing Academic English; 
7.  Nonverbal communication, or body language, is used everywhere in the world. It is a very powerful means of communication. It communicates much more than spoken words. One example of nonverbal communication is what occurs between parents and child. Parents smile at their child. They communicate love, acceptance, and reassurance. The child feels comfortable and safe. The smile signifies approval. The child is happy and well-adjusted. 
8.  Key: 
9.  Replace weak word with strong word: communicate->covey or deliver; 
10. everywhere 模糊, 不能用; 
11. very powerful 不能用; 
12. much more => convey more; 
13. 短句会碎片化, 结构常常是fact+opinion; 长句借助parallelism, 把opinion也包装成facts (comments + opinion)
14.

2. Male chauvinism extends even into the area of automobile driving, it seems. Believing that they are far better drivers than women. Men consider women drivers incompetent, inattentive, and even dangerous behind the wheel. 
3. However, statistics prove that women are, in fact, safer drivers than men. For example, insurance rates. Insurance rates for women are 20 percent lower than they are for men. Another proof is that more accidents are caused by male drivers between the ages of 18 &nd 25 than by any other group. Also, the greater percentage of a.coidents involving deaths caused by men. Although women are criticized for being too cautious. They are really just being safe drivers.
4. The reasons for women drivers' safer driving habits can perhaps be found in the differing attitudes of the sexes toward automobiles. On the one hand, women drivers who regard the automobile as a convenience. Like a washing machine. On the other hand, men regard the automobile as an extension of their egos.3 Using it as a weapon when they feel particularly aggressive. Or using it as a status symbol. 
5. All in all, women are safer drivers. Because of their attitude. Men can learn to become safe drivers. If they adopt the attitude that an automobile is merely a convenience.

# A Bridge to Creditability and Authority
## Preface
## Chapter 1, Features and Techniques of Academic Writing in English
### 1.1 Features of Academic Writing in English
### 1.2 Genre-focused approaches: to base writing on reading 
### 1.3 Some frequently used skills in academic papers

## Chapter 2, An Access to Disciplinary Authority and Its Evaluation
### 2.1 Definition and classification of academic papers
### 2.2 Examination criteria of a paper’s academic value
1. **Author’s credential**: Examine whether an author’s credentials show him or her to be an authority on a subject or have a special perspective on it. An author’s **academic degrees** (such as M.D., ph. D., M.B.A.) suggest having specialized education in the field, while **affiliations** (with a university or organization) help establish authority. **Other works** the author has published also tell a lot about the authority on a discipline-specific subject. 
2. **Appropriate focus**: Examine whether the source addresses the topic in a helpful way. The subtitles may suggest whether the author’s point of view on the subject or topic is a particular and useful one. A paper from a conference proceeding may focus on original idea and data treatment; while a journal paper can rearrange the goals and design of a research with emphasis on the interpretation of the results. A paper of Nature may tell the research community an outstanding discovery while a paper from a discipline-specific journal can tell the researchers what is going on within a “hot topic”. 
3. **Sufficient coverage**: Examine whether the source covers the topic sufficiently. A thorough presentation over a topic may help researchers understand the process of research design, the detailed methodology, the materials supporting an argument and even the limitations of the study within the research domain. 
4. **Reputable publisher or journal**: university, academic, educational or trade presses publish most of the books while most of the prestigious journals belong to certain national or international affiliations. **Impact factor** provided by some national institutes or organizations may help identify whether the publisher or the journal holds an important academic status. A larger staff or referees suggest comprehensive operation and multiple points of view. However, smaller, less important journals also serve research needs. Different publishers may specialize in different kinds of books. So it is important to learn to recognize the important publishers in researchers’ fields. 
5. **Affiliations or sponsorship**: Examine whether you can get an easy access to the sources you need. Most of the important affiliations indicate directly and even offer a professional web site which may help researchers subscribe the papers. Sometimes the sites have multiple affiliations and sponsorships ---for example, with an organization (such as National Council of Teachers of English) and a government agency (such as the Department of Education). In such cases, the focuses of the individual sponsors generally are subsumed by the broader, shared goals of the sponsorship partners.
6. **Currentness**: A paper’s currentness involves original submitting date, revision date and publication date. Some publications (books or journals) directly indicate the publishing date with editions or issues.  For many topics, sources older than five or ten years have limited value. However, in some research cases, using old sources may help build a historical context. 
7. **Documentation**: Examine whether the supplementary materials are sufficient enough to prove the paper’s originality. To clarity the primary materials and secondary sources,  including the in-text illustrations, tables, charts, graphs or diagrams; bibliographies or references; and sections containing special supporting materials, such as case studies or collections of additional readings. In a journal, check for the related materials within the same issue. Sometimes, entire issues are organized in whole or in part around a theme which may help determine the value of different articles around one topic. Abandon the articles whose facts or technical information are not documented appropriately. 
8. **Availability**: A variety of sources, such as print source, audiovisual sources and Internet sources, may distract searchers while they contribute to conveniences. In search of the disciplinary authority, the links available should also be evaluated. Flexible approaches may range from reviewing titles and subtitles to carefully examining the data treatments. Incorporate in your efforts a wide range of sources--- books, magazines (periodicals), journals, news letters, science reports, conference notes (proceedings) and electronic sources --- to ensure that you can take advantage of the strengths that each provides.  
9. **Appropriateness**: Writing style may influence understanding of a paper and judgment over the value. Check for the developing skills used in the paper, including examples and facts or narration and description. Further examine the persuasiveness of the arguments, including supporting claims, document facts and discussion. Native writers and non-native writers may vary in style though they share frequent use of technical terms or vocabulary. A credible source should always justify its writing style serving the argumentation system.
