5. 避免考试中固化的结构, as we all know, with the development of, in order to, etc. (2022年10月22日)
6. chatGPT: It is generally not recommended to use the phrase "**as we all know**" in academic writing. This is because it can be seen as making assumptions about the reader's knowledge or implying that there is a consensus on the topic being discussed, which may not be the case. It is better to provide evidence and support for any claims or information presented in the paper. (2023年2月19日)
7. chatGPT: The use of "**with the development of**" is acceptable in academic writing, but it should be used appropriately and not overused. It can be used to introduce a new idea or concept that has emerged as a result of advancements in a particular field. However, it is important to be specific about the development being referred to and **avoid using it as a general statement**. It is also advisable to vary the language used to introduce new ideas and concepts to avoid repetition and enhance the overall quality of the writing. (2023年2月19日)
8. chatGPT: In academic writing, it is generally recommended to use more concise alternatives to "in order to", such as "**to**" or "**for**". This is because "in order to" can sometimes be seen as wordy and unnecessary, which can disrupt the flow of your writing and make it harder for readers to understand your meaning. (2023年2月19日)

These words or phrases help to create a logical flow between the different topics.

16. A. In Britain only 9% of over sixties live with their families, in contrast to 29% in Japan.
17. B. In Britain only 9% of over sixties live with their families, in contrast, 29% in Japan.
18. Key: A; in contrast to是一个点, in contrast是面, 太大了; 
19. chatGPT: Option A is the better statement. The use of "**in contrast to**" is more appropriate than "in contrast," as the former is a preposition that is commonly used to introduce a contrast between two things, while the latter is a phrase that can be confusing to some readers. (2023年2月19日)
20. (2) 
21. A. It was assumed that computer users with better computer confidence tend to have favorable perception of computer tasks. 
22. B. It assumes that computer users with better computer confidence tend to have favorable perception of computer tasks.

26. B. The birth rate has dropped over the past ten years because of the stagflation.
27. Key B; owing to 带有情感色彩; 
28. chatGPT: "**Dropped**" is a more precise verb than "reduced," and "**because of**" is clearer and simpler than "owing to." Additionally, "economic stagflation" is redundant because stagflation inherently refers to an economic condition. (2023年2月19日)
29. (4) 
30. A. House prices have raised by 70% in the past 5 years in most big cities of China.
31. B. In the past 5 years, there has been a rise of 70% in house prices in most big cities of China.

45. (4) The Internet makes our life easier and richer. At the same time, it changes our sense of time in many aspects. 
46. N, 错在at the same time, EAP不接受时序概念; => while; 
47. chatGPT: The connection "At the same time" is often used in spoken language to indicate a contrast or a simultaneous occurrence of events. In academic writing, it is recommended to use more formal and specific connectives such as "**Furthermore**," "**Moreover**," "**In addition**," "**Additionally**," "**Conversely**," etc. to make the relationship between sentences clearer and more precise. // A possible revision for this example could be: "The Internet has **not only** improved the convenience and abundance of our daily life **but also** exerted significant influences on our temporal perception. **Moreover**, the changes are pervasive and multifaceted."
48. (6) Emergency aid can help in the short term, but that is not the answer in the long run. 
49. that is not the answer in the long run口语化 => but unhelpful in the long run; 
50. (9) In our daily life, the Internet provides us many interesting things like games, movies, music and so on which make us happy and relaxed. And also, it can make our life and work easy and efficient.

2. A3: 草蛇灰线, 伏脉千里; 
3. Chapter 1 Exercise 2: 
4. (1) In the field of second language (L2) writing, about the development of culturally diverse L2 students’ critical thinking ability, there have been considerable discussions. 
5. 多个(不是同级别)的介词分化, 导致句子碎片化, 修改应把about放在discussion之后; 
6. (2) Critical thinking is frequently seen in Western tertiary context as a necessary component of academic writing in subject guide-lines, assessment criteria and in written feedback on student’s assignments (Woodward-Kron, 2002). 
7. 介词次序紊乱, 需要有等级概念, 把in the wester提前; 
8. (3) The widely accepted assumption in the current debate over critical thinking pedagogies (Atkinson, 1997) is based on extensive investigations of ESL students’ difficulties with argumentative /analytical writing assignments (Ballard and Clanchy, 1991; Fox, 1994; Pally,1997, 2001; Spack, 1997; Stapleton, 2001;Woodward-Kron, 2002).
9. 概念中心紊乱, 定义漂移; 
10. (4) However, disagreements about whether critical thinking pedagogies should be adopted in the L2 writing classroom, and how ESL students could be guided towards critical thinking in academic writing arise.
11. 头重脚轻, arise提前, 放到disagreement之后; 
12. 
13. Exercise on Page 18 of Slides "徐喜文EAP writing VS EGP writing （2022 S版）": 
14. (2) Y, 主体变agreement; 
15. (3) To our surprise, these techniques were so quickly applied into practice. 
16. Key: N, to our surprise和so quickly具有情感色彩; => There is an **obvious** fact that XXX have been **widely** applied... 
17. chatGPT: They could also rephrase the sentence to be more objective and less personal by omitting "to our surprise" and using a more formal phrase such as "**remarkably**" or "**unexpectedly**."
18. (14) Now that globalization has become a must, we are supposed to adapt to and take full advantage of it rather than escape from it.  
19. Key: N, Now that... a must 高调, 情绪化, 其中不定冠词a表达强调; 
20. chatGPT: The use of "must" and "supposed to" may suggest a personal or informal opinion, rather than a supported and objective argument. Additionally, the phrase "take full advantage of it" lacks specificity and precision. // In academic writing, it is important to use precise language and to present arguments based on research and evidence, rather than personal opinions or assumptions. Therefore, the sentence could be revised to better align with academic writing standards, such as: "**Given the prevalence** of globalization, **there is a need** for **individuals and organizations** to **adapt to its effects and leverage its opportunities** through strategic actions and policies, **supported by empirical research**."
21. (15) Y, plainness. 
22. EGP often use metaphors and analogies (i.e. as old saying goes), which EAP should avoid. // delete SSFC like TRIZ; 
23. EAP should avoid something/anything 等不定代词, 因为这属于模糊概念;

2. Exercise on Page 27 of Slides "徐喜文EAP writing VS EGP writing （2022 S版）": : 
3. (2) By and large, our conception of time has changed a lot along with the rapid development of the Internet.
4. N. With the rapid developement of...
5. chatGPT: The phrase "by and large" is more commonly used in informal or conversational language, and its use in academic writing can sound too casual. Similarly, "a lot" is often considered too informal for academic writing and can be replaced with a more precise term that conveys the intended meaning. // Additionally, the sentence lacks specific evidence or data to support the claim that the conception of time has changed greatly due to the development of the Internet. In academic writing, it is important to provide evidence and specific examples to support claims and arguments. // Revised version: The rapid development of the Internet has significantly altered our conception of time. (2023年2月20日)
6. (3) From my perspective, it is high time we joined in the globalization tendency and put it forward in the meantime. 
7. Key: N. 试图共情; 
8. chatGPT: The phrase "from my perspective" is subjective and does not add any academic value to the sentence. Additionally, the phrase "it is high time" is somewhat colloquial and may not be appropriate in formal academic writing. // A more appropriate version of this sentence in academic writing could be: "The current trend towards globalization **presents an opportunity to** actively engage with and contribute to the global community."
9.  (7) There is one more thing: Try not to act toward your coworkers and bosses as you have acted toward us. 
10. Key: N. 口语化; 
11. chatGPT: The sentence does not fully meet the standards of English academic writing because it is too informal and contains imperative language, which can come across as rude or confrontational. In academic writing, it is important to use formal language and maintain a respectful and professional tone. A more appropriate way to express this idea might be: "It is important to maintain professional and respectful behavior with coworkers and superiors, avoiding any actions that might cause offense or disrupt workplace harmony."
12. (8) Worse still, when you were boring in class, professors acted as if you were saying something important. 
13. N. worse still 情感浓厚; 
14. chatGPT: This sentence does not fully conform to the standards of English academic writing. The use of the word "worse still" and the informal tone of the phrase "when you were boring in class" may be considered too casual or colloquial for academic writing. In addition, the phrasing of "professors acted as if you were saying something important" lacks clarity and precision. A more suitable academic phrasing would be "Despite a lack of engagement, professors often responded to students' contributions in class with an assumption of importance."
15. (9) Free-diving is more than just a sport; it is also a quick and efficient way to access and research some of the ocean’s most mysterious animals. 
16. Key: N. 
17. chatGPT: The use of "just" may imply a casual tone, and the phrase "access and research" may be seen as overly informal. // A possible revision for the sentence to be more suitable for academic writing could be: Free-diving is a valuable method for researching some of the ocean's most enigmatic creatures because of its effectiveness and efficiency beyond being just a sport.
18. In order to => To; 
19. As a matter of fact (读者会质疑matter是什么) => In fact OR indeed; 
20. in terms of... 
21. 
22. Chapter 3 Exercise 1: 
23. (1) References should be **given** first alphabetically and then further **provided** chronologically if necessary. 
24. Key: given => listed; provided => sorted; 
25. (2) The Author Gateway also provides the facility to **check** accepted articles and **offer** email alerts to tell you when an article’s status has changed.
26. Key: show => track; offer => set up; 
27. (3) Research highlights are a short collection of bullet points that **show** the core findings of the article. Research highlights are optional and should be **given** in a separate file in the online submission system.
28. Key: show => convey; give => submit; 
29. (4) We do not **put** a fixed limit of paper length, however, your manuscript should **be** between 4000-8000 words or 15-25 pages in a double spaced, one-inch margins and 11-12 point font format. 
30. put => have; be => fall; 
31. (5) In the section of “Corresponding author”, please clearly **tell** who is the corresponding author willing to **deal with** correspondence at all stages of refereeing and publication, also post-publication.
32. tell => indicate; deal with => handle;

14. B: Authorship should be limited to those who have made a significant contribution to the conception, design, execution, or interpretation of the reported study.
15. Key: B. limit转名词被凸显, 但是显得粗暴; 因为重要的内容在后面, 所以没必要用这么强的语气; 
16. (3) 
17. A: Citation of a reference as “in press” means that the item has been accepted for publication.

30. (2) No one can deny that the computer has had a great effect upon the business world.

36. (6) The past decades have witnessed the epic changes in all aspects of our society since the Internet is deeply rooted into our life. 
37. Key: N. deeply rooted是描述性行为 => closely related; our => the people's; epic => significant; 
38. chatGPT: "Epic changes" is not an objective or precise term to use in academic writing. It is better to use more specific and factual words. // The phrase "all aspects of our society" is too broad and vague. It is better to be specific about which aspects of society are being referred to. // The use of the phrase "since the Internet is deeply rooted into our life" is not grammatically correct. It would be better to say "since the Internet has become deeply rooted in our lives" or "since the widespread adoption of the Internet." // A possible revised sentence could be: Over the past few decades, the **adoption of** the Internet has **led to significant changes** in various aspects of society, including communication, education, and business.

12. This paper examines the causes and satisfaction consequences of work-to-family and family-to-work synergy for a sample of organizationally-employed parents while controlling two types of work-family conflict: work interfering with family and family interfering with work. Participants included 1193 respondents from the 2002 National Study of the Changing Workforce who had a child under the age of 18 years at home. Work-family synergy is the frequency of experiencing positive energy and mood states from participating in both work and family. Synergy was significantly related to attitude toward employer, learning opportunities, autonomy, job pressure, supervisor support, dependent care, family income, mental health, self-rated health, and satisfaction outcomes. Gender similarities and differences in work-family synergy were identified. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

1. Page 92 in Book Writing Academic English; Write paraphrases of the following passage.  
2. Since the time of Descartes, it is estimated that no fewer than five hundred attempts have been made to create artificial languages for international use. The most successful by far has been Esperanto(世界语), a language constructed around the end of the nineteenth century by Dr. Zamenhof of Poland. Esperanto is a language that is extremely easy to learn and speak, with its words drawn mainly from English, German, the Romance languages, Latin, and Greek. 
3. A more recent arrival on the international scene is Interlingua, scientifically constructed by a group of language experts out of Latin, the Romance languages, and English. But whereas Esperanto has a large body of people who actually speak it scattered throughout the world, Interlingua has not yet achieved much popularity (Pei 175-176).

During training, when they do something correctly, they squeal excitedly and. race toward their trainer. When they make a mistake, however, they droops noticeably and mope around their pool. Furthermore, they help each other when they are in trouble. If one is sick, it sends out a message, and others in the area swim to help it. They push it to the surface of the wa.ter so that it can breathe. They stay with it for days or weeks-until it recovers or dies. They have also helped trapped or lost whales navigate their way safely out to the open sea.

Another proof is that more accidents are caused by male drivers between the ages of 18 &nd 25 than by any other group. Also, the greater percentage of a.coidents involving deaths caused by men. Although women are criticized for being too cautious. They are really just being safe drivers.
4. The reasons for women drivers' safer driving habits can perhaps be found in the differing attitudes of the sexes toward automobiles. On the one hand, women drivers who regard the automobile as a convenience. Like a washing machine. On the other hand, men regard the automobile as an extension of their egos.3 Using it as a weapon when they feel particularly aggressive. Or using it as a status symbol.

4. The United States counts its population every ten years, and each census' reveals that the racial and ethnic mix is changing dramatically, so(=>**And**) by the year 2050, the "average" American will not be descended from Europeans, but the majority of U.S. residents will trace their ancestry to Africa, Asia, the Hispanic world, the Pacific Islands, or the Middle East. Once (the United States was) a microcosm of European nationalities, today the United States is a microcosm of the world. (+**Therefore**, 逻辑连接) The United States is no longer considered a "melting pot" society by many of its residents. "Instead, many people prefer the term "salad bowl." (They use this term to describe American society.)(not need, 啰嗦) American society will soon be predominantly nonwhite.

7. The "women's lib" movement toward greater equality for women has produced some permanent changes in the vocabulary of English. New words have been added. (For example) The words feminist, sexist, and male chauvinist have become common during the past thirty-five years or so. Another new word is the title Ms., which is often used in place of both Miss and Mrs. (**Furthermore**, 第二层, 补充内容) A change is that sexist titles of many occupations have been neutralized. (For example, 举例子) A chairman is now a chairperson (or sometimes simply chair), a waiter/waitress is now a waitperson, and a high school or college freshman is now a first-year student. A mailman is now a mail carrier, and an airline stewardess is now a flight attendant. In time, English pronouns may also change as a result of women's desire for equality. (**In fact**, 事实性陈述) Attempts to give equal treatment to masculine and feminine pronouns in English have led to the search for a new pronoun form to replace he (such as he/she or s/he) when referring to neutral nouns like student and manager. Some of the new words such as Ms. are quite useful; you can use Ms. to address a woman when you don't know if she is married. The lack of a clear neutral pronoun can lead to awkward sentence construction.

22. (2) Since the study conducted by Dewaele and MacIntyre (2014), which is situated within the Positive Psychology movement extended to second language acquisition and is the first to argue that we should adopt a holistic view on diverse emotions, a robust increase in attention has been paid to a great variety of emotions beyond anxiety. 
23. chatGPT: Since Dewaele and MacIntyre's (2014) study, which **is grounded in** the Positive Psychology movement and **advocates for a holistic approach** to understanding diverse emotions in second language acquisition, **there has been a significant increase in attention given to** a wide range of emotions, beyond just anxiety.

# A Bridge to Creditability and Authority
## Preface
## Chapter 1, Features and Techniques of Academic Writing in English
### 1.1 Features of Academic Writing in English
### 1.2 Genre-focused approaches: to base writing on reading 
### 1.3 Some frequently used skills in academic papers

## Chapter 2, An Access to Disciplinary Authority and Its Evaluation
### 2.1 Definition and classification of academic papers
### 2.2 Examination criteria of a paper’s academic value
1. **Author’s credential**: Examine whether an author’s credentials show him or her to be an authority on a subject or have a special perspective on it. An author’s **academic degrees** (such as M.D., ph. D., M.B.A.) suggest having specialized education in the field, while **affiliations** (with a university or organization) help establish authority. **Other works** the author has published also tell a lot about the authority on a discipline-specific subject. 
2. **Appropriate focus**: Examine whether the source addresses the topic in a helpful way. The subtitles may suggest whether the author’s point of view on the subject or topic is a particular and useful one. A paper from a conference proceeding may focus on original idea and data treatment; while a journal paper can rearrange the goals and design of a research with emphasis on the interpretation of the results. A paper of Nature may tell the research community an outstanding discovery while a paper from a discipline-specific journal can tell the researchers what is going on within a “hot topic”. 
3. **Sufficient coverage**: Examine whether the source covers the topic sufficiently. A thorough presentation over a topic may help researchers understand the process of research design, the detailed methodology, the materials supporting an argument and even the limitations of the study within the research domain. 
4. **Reputable publisher or journal**: university, academic, educational or trade presses publish most of the books while most of the prestigious journals belong to certain national or international affiliations. **Impact factor** provided by some national institutes or organizations may help identify whether the publisher or the journal holds an important academic status. A larger staff or referees suggest comprehensive operation and multiple points of view. However, smaller, less important journals also serve research needs. Different publishers may specialize in different kinds of books. So it is important to learn to recognize the important publishers in researchers’ fields. 
5. **Affiliations or sponsorship**: Examine whether you can get an easy access to the sources you need. Most of the important affiliations indicate directly and even offer a professional web site which may help researchers subscribe the papers. Sometimes the sites have multiple affiliations and sponsorships ---for example, with an organization (such as National Council of Teachers of English) and a government agency (such as the Department of Education). In such cases, the focuses of the individual sponsors generally are subsumed by the broader, shared goals of the sponsorship partners.
6. **Currentness**: A paper’s currentness involves original submitting date, revision date and publication date. Some publications (books or journals) directly indicate the publishing date with editions or issues.  For many topics, sources older than five or ten years have limited value. However, in some research cases, using old sources may help build a historical context. 
7. **Documentation**: Examine whether the supplementary materials are sufficient enough to prove the paper’s originality. To clarity the primary materials and secondary sources,  including the in-text illustrations, tables, charts, graphs or diagrams; bibliographies or references; and sections containing special supporting materials, such as case studies or collections of additional readings. In a journal, check for the related materials within the same issue. Sometimes, entire issues are organized in whole or in part around a theme which may help determine the value of different articles around one topic. Abandon the articles whose facts or technical information are not documented appropriately. 
8. **Availability**: A variety of sources, such as print source, audiovisual sources and Internet sources, may distract searchers while they contribute to conveniences. In search of the disciplinary authority, the links available should also be evaluated. Flexible approaches may range from reviewing titles and subtitles to carefully examining the data treatments. Incorporate in your efforts a wide range of sources--- books, magazines (periodicals), journals, news letters, science reports, conference notes (proceedings) and electronic sources --- to ensure that you can take advantage of the strengths that each provides.  
9. **Appropriateness**: Writing style may influence understanding of a paper and judgment over the value. Check for the developing skills used in the paper, including examples and facts or narration and description. Further examine the persuasiveness of the arguments, including supporting claims, document facts and discussion. Native writers and non-native writers may vary in style though they share frequent use of technical terms or vocabulary. A credible source should always justify its writing style serving the argumentation system.

# Xu's question to pay attention to
## Linguistic features
### L1: How to achieve plainness, precision and objectivity while following the stereotype of writing in English as writers did in preparation for some L2 testing essays? 
1. Pay attention to **plain, precise and objective expression**; (2023年1月19日)
2. chatGPT: To achieve plainness, precision, and objectivity in writing, it is important to use **clear** and simple language, avoid using overly complex sentence structures, and provide **evidence and examples** to support any claims made. To follow the stereotype of writing in English as used in preparation for L2 testing essays, it is important to adhere to **standard grammar** and punctuation rules, use a **formal and academic tone**, and avoid using colloquial or idiomatic expressions. Additionally, it is important to be objective and avoid using personal bias or opinion in the writing. (2023年1月19日)

### L2: May the writer’s preferences of some single verbs, like “find” or ”look into” instead of “identify” “or investigate”, remind readers of an immature writer? 
1. Pay attention to **more formal expression**. (2023年1月19日)
2. chatGPT: It is possible that a writer's preference for certain single verbs, such as "find" or "look into" instead of "identify" or "investigate," may remind some readers of an immature writer. However, it is important to note that writing style and word choice are subjective, and what one person perceives as immature may be viewed differently by another. It is important for a writer to use language that is **clear, precise, and appropriate** for their intended audience. It is also important to note that the use of specific words or phrases can convey a **particular tone** or emphasis that may be desired by the writer. Additionally, it is also important to consider the context and the **purpose of the writing**, as the use of certain words may be more appropriate in certain situations or genres. (2023年1月19日)

### L3: To what extent should a writer invite “self (say I or we)” into text while constructing a voice of authority in the paper? 
1. NO NEED, because our paper contain at least two people; (2023年1月19日)
2. chatGPT: The use of "self" (such as "I" or "we") in a text can be a tricky balancing act when constructing a voice of authority in a paper. On one hand, the use of "I" or "we" can make the writing feel more personal and approachable, which can be beneficial for certain genres or audiences. On the other hand, the use of "I" or "we" can also weaken the author's authority and objectivity if used excessively. // It is generally best to use "I" or "we" sparingly and strategically, especially in academic and professional writing where objectivity and authority are highly valued. When using "I" or "we", it is important to make sure that it is clear that the author is speaking from their own perspective and not making universal claims. // It is also important to use "I" or "we" when it is necessary to provide context or background information about the author's own experiences or research. In many cases, it is more appropriate to use third person point of view in academic or professional writing, as it emphasizes the research and the evidence rather than the writer's personal opinions. // Overall, it is important to consider the purpose and audience of the writing when deciding to use "I" or "we" and use it in a way that supports the author's credibility and authority.

### L4: Could a new writer follow the use of informal expressions as the professional writers and expert writers did in their papers? 
1. NO NEED, because I am new writer; (2023年1月19日)
2. chatGPT: It is possible for a new writer to use informal expressions in their writing, but it is important to keep in mind that the use of informal language is generally more appropriate for certain types of writing, such as creative writing or casual writing, rather than academic or professional writing. In these types of writing, a more **formal and professional tone** is usually expected, and the use of informal language can weaken the writer's authority and credibility. // If a new writer is writing in an academic or professional setting, it is best to stick to formal language and avoid using overly casual or colloquial expressions. However, it is important to note that writing style and tone can vary depending on the field, the audience and the purpose of the writing. Therefore, it is always important to familiarize oneself with conventions and expectations of the type of writing you are doing. // If a new writer wants to use informal expressions in their writing, they should do it with caution and consider the context of their writing, it's audience and the tone they want to convey. They should also be aware that the use of informal expressions may make the writing less formal and less persuasive, and the writer should be prepared to explain the reason for the use of informal language.

In the **natural sciences**, the word "method" might be more preferred. // In other cases, the use of certain terminologies may be influenced by historical or cultural factors. For example, certain terms may have been popularized or developed by **influential scholars or institutions** in a particular field, and their use may have become deeply ingrained in the discipline. // In other fields, terminologies may be dynamic and can change over time as new technologies, theories, or discoveries are made. In these fields, the researchers may have to adopt new terminologies or redefine the existing ones to adapt to the new developments. // Additionally, terminologies may also vary depending on the audience and the purpose of the research. For example, technical terms may be used when communicating with other experts in the field, while simpler terms may be used when communicating with a lay audience. // In summary, the preference and use of certain terminologies may be influenced by a variety of factors, including the discipline, historical and cultural factors, the audience and the purpose of the research and the evolution of the field.

### L7: Does the ignorance of the nuance of some nominalizations, like discourse and language, acquisition and learning, cause any extent of bias among the reviewers? 
1. Same as L1; (2023年1月19日)
2. chatGPT: Ignorance of the nuances of certain nominalizations, such as "discourse" and "language," "acquisition" and "learning," **can potentially cause bias among reviewers**. Nominalizations are words that describe an action, process or state but are turned into nouns. They often have different connotations and implications, and thus, it is important to understand the subtle differences in meaning between them. // For example, "discourse" and "language" may be used interchangeably, but they can also have different connotations. "Discourse" is often used to refer to the way language is used in a particular context, often with a focus on the social and cultural factors that influence it. On the other hand, "language" is more general, and it refers to the system of communication used by a particular group of people. // Similarly, "acquisition" and "learning" can be used interchangeably, but they can also have different connotations. "Acquisition" is often used to refer to the process of **gaining knowledge or skills through experience or exposure**, while "learning" is more general and can refer to any process by which knowledge or skills are acquired. // If a reviewer is not aware of these nuances in meaning, they may not fully understand the author's argument or the context of the research, and this may lead to bias in their evaluation of the work. Therefore, it is important for both authors and reviewers to have a clear understanding of the meanings of the words they use and to use them appropriately in the context of their writing.

### L8: Does the pursuit of accuracy always demand use of long sentences? Or does complexity of sentence structure mean complicated ideas? 
1. Pay attention to **structure of sentences**. (2023年1月19日)
2. chatGPT: The pursuit of accuracy does not always demand the use of long sentences, and complexity of sentence structure does not always mean complicated ideas. Clear and concise writing is often more effective in conveying complex ideas, as it helps the reader to understand the main points more easily. // Long sentences can make it difficult for readers to follow the main idea, and they may also increase the risk of errors or ambiguities. Therefore, when striving for accuracy, it is important to use simple and direct language and to express ideas as clearly and succinctly as possible. // However, it's also important to note that the length of a sentence and its complexity can depend on the context and the audience. For example, in scientific or technical writing, longer and more complex sentences may be more appropriate, as they allow the author to convey specific information with precision. // In summary, accuracy and concision are not mutually exclusive. Striving for accuracy should not always demand the use of long sentences, and complexity of sentence structure does not always mean complicated ideas. Clear, concise and direct language can be more effective in conveying complex ideas. The length and complexity of sentences should be adapted to the context and the audience.

### L9: Does high frequency using of passive voice always help build up high quality paper while enhancing the persuasiveness and achieving objectivity? 
1. Pay attention to **passive voice**. (2023年1月19日)
2. chatGPT: The use of passive voice can be a useful tool in writing, but it is not always the best choice for building a high-quality paper or enhancing persuasiveness and objectivity. // Passive voice can be used to shift the focus away from the person or group performing an action, which can be useful for **achieving objectivity** in scientific or technical writing. For example, in a scientific study, it is more appropriate to report the results without highlighting the person or group who conducted the study, because the focus is on the results themselves. // However, using passive voice excessively can make writing less clear, less concise, and less engaging. Passive voice can also make sentences longer, and it can make it harder for readers to understand who is performing an action. // Additionally, using passive voice can also make it **harder to build persuasive arguments** because it can reduce the sense of agency and accountability. Passive voice can also make it harder to identify the actors in the text and that can make it harder for the readers to understand the text. // In summary, while passive voice can be a useful tool in some cases, such as in scientific or technical writing to **achieve objectivity**, it is not always the best choice for building a high-quality paper or **enhancing persuasiveness**. It's important to use it appropriately and in balance with other sentence structures.
