# A Bridge to Creditability and Authority
## Preface
## Chapter 1, Features and Techniques of Academic Writing in English
### 1.1 Features of Academic Writing in English
### 1.2 Genre-focused approaches: to base writing on reading 
### 1.3 Some frequently used skills in academic papers

## Chapter 2, An Access to Disciplinary Authority and Its Evaluation
### 2.1 Definition and classification of academic papers
### 2.2 Examination criteria of a paper’s academic value
1. **Author’s credential**: Examine whether an author’s credentials show him or her to be an authority on a subject or have a special perspective on it. An author’s **academic degrees** (such as M.D., ph. D., M.B.A.) suggest having specialized education in the field, while **affiliations** (with a university or organization) help establish authority. **Other works** the author has published also tell a lot about the authority on a discipline-specific subject. 
2. **Appropriate focus**: Examine whether the source addresses the topic in a helpful way. The subtitles may suggest whether the author’s point of view on the subject or topic is a particular and useful one. A paper from a conference proceeding may focus on original idea and data treatment; while a journal paper can rearrange the goals and design of a research with emphasis on the interpretation of the results. A paper of Nature may tell the research community an outstanding discovery while a paper from a discipline-specific journal can tell the researchers what is going on within a “hot topic”. 
3. **Sufficient coverage**: Examine whether the source covers the topic sufficiently. A thorough presentation over a topic may help researchers understand the process of research design, the detailed methodology, the materials supporting an argument and even the limitations of the study within the research domain. 
4. **Reputable publisher or journal**: university, academic, educational or trade presses publish most of the books while most of the prestigious journals belong to certain national or international affiliations. **Impact factor** provided by some national institutes or organizations may help identify whether the publisher or the journal holds an important academic status. A larger staff or referees suggest comprehensive operation and multiple points of view. However, smaller, less important journals also serve research needs. Different publishers may specialize in different kinds of books. So it is important to learn to recognize the important publishers in researchers’ fields. 
5. **Affiliations or sponsorship**: Examine whether you can get an easy access to the sources you need. Most of the important affiliations indicate directly and even offer a professional web site which may help researchers subscribe the papers. Sometimes the sites have multiple affiliations and sponsorships ---for example, with an organization (such as National Council of Teachers of English) and a government agency (such as the Department of Education). In such cases, the focuses of the individual sponsors generally are subsumed by the broader, shared goals of the sponsorship partners.
6. **Currentness**: A paper’s currentness involves original submitting date, revision date and publication date. Some publications (books or journals) directly indicate the publishing date with editions or issues.  For many topics, sources older than five or ten years have limited value. However, in some research cases, using old sources may help build a historical context. 
7. **Documentation**: Examine whether the supplementary materials are sufficient enough to prove the paper’s originality. To clarity the primary materials and secondary sources,  including the in-text illustrations, tables, charts, graphs or diagrams; bibliographies or references; and sections containing special supporting materials, such as case studies or collections of additional readings. In a journal, check for the related materials within the same issue. Sometimes, entire issues are organized in whole or in part around a theme which may help determine the value of different articles around one topic. Abandon the articles whose facts or technical information are not documented appropriately. 
8. **Availability**: A variety of sources, such as print source, audiovisual sources and Internet sources, may distract searchers while they contribute to conveniences. In search of the disciplinary authority, the links available should also be evaluated. Flexible approaches may range from reviewing titles and subtitles to carefully examining the data treatments. Incorporate in your efforts a wide range of sources--- books, magazines (periodicals), journals, news letters, science reports, conference notes (proceedings) and electronic sources --- to ensure that you can take advantage of the strengths that each provides.  
9. **Appropriateness**: Writing style may influence understanding of a paper and judgment over the value. Check for the developing skills used in the paper, including examples and facts or narration and description. Further examine the persuasiveness of the arguments, including supporting claims, document facts and discussion. Native writers and non-native writers may vary in style though they share frequent use of technical terms or vocabulary. A credible source should always justify its writing style serving the argumentation system.
